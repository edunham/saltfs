Note: this directory is meant to be used to TEMPORARILY test out changes
to our Salt configurations on the live builders.

To get started, clone the saltfs repo using the `setup.sh` script.
Make any changes you want inside the `saltfs` directory.
When you're done, make sure to run the `cleanup.sh` script.

This folder takes precedence over gitfs
(which reads file from the master branch of the saltfs repository),
so it is important to follow a few guidelines:

- Avoid using this folder if possible: prefer to test changes locally
  using the steps under "Salt workflow" in the `docs/salt.md` file.

- If you do need to use this folder, use it only as long as you need it,
  and make sure to run the `cleanup.sh` script afterwards.
  Any files that are left dangling will continue to mask changes
  in the real saltfs repository.

- There is only one of these folders, so if it's already in use,
  wait until it is empty again before testing your change.
  You can look at the CLONER file inside the clone to see who
  created the clone and at what time they did so.
  Note that the timestamp is in UTC.
